//THE CASCADE OPERATOR:

/*
The above example invokes the methods in the class. However, every time a function
 is called, a reference to the object is required. The cascade operator can be 
 used as a shorthand in cases where there is a sequence of invocations.
The cascade ( .. ) operator can be used to issue a sequence of calls via an
 object. The above example can be rewritten in the following manner.
*/

class Student { 
   void test_method() { 
      print("This is a  test method"); 
   } 
   
   void test_method1() { 
      print("This is a  test method1"); 
   } 
}  
void main() { 
   new Student() 
   ..test_method() 
   ..test_method1();
